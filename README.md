# Book Search Engine With MERn


## Task 
In this weeks task I was really challenged. We had to take starter code that was using REST and tweak it to use Apollo
as well as Graphql with queries and mutations.

## User Story

Given that I am an avid reader
I would like to search for books online.
Then I can sign up and save the books to my profile.
